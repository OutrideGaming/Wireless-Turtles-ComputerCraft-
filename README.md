Program: RemoteTurtle
Pastebin Link: http://pastebin.com/BrKdZTxy

Instructions:
  1. In the turtle/computer/pocket computer, type:
        pastebin get BrKdZTxy startup
  2. After success, type in command line "startup"
        - after first run, it'll run automatically whenever you open the computer or turtle.
  3. Answer the questions (guide below)
  4. Type /list for commands
  
Guide:

  Question 1:
      Does this program already exist on your device?
      Answer can be "yes/no"
      
  Question 2:
      Do you want this device to transmit or receive?
      Answer can be "receive/transmit"
      Set turtles to receivers, and computers to transmitters.
      
  Question 3:
       What ID would you like to link to?
       This ID will be shown in the other device, it will say "this is computer #[number]"
       Type that number in the other device, this makes it so that you can only link 1 computer to 1 turtle.
       
Welcome to suggestions, ideas, and feedback.

I don't own the code, I've just gone back and changed some things as well as re-uploaded the code to pastebin. The NanoBob's code isn't available on pastebin, but it was available on the forum post.

Things I'm working on:
  Tunnel command
    Currently you can only dig 1 block at a time.
  Multiple commands
    - Follow ups, such as moving left, then forward, then right and so on.
    - Input number, so the turtle can move X times.
